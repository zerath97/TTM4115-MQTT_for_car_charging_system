# TTM4115 - Electronic car charging station: We created charging units that could charge an electronic car. Sensehat display was added to give the end-user more quality of service.
Using Raspberry Pi with SenseHat display we created a system for electronic car charging. The communication was done with MQTT and HTTP. One Raspberry Pi was used as a car and another as a charging station.
